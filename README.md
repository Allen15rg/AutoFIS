AutoFIS: Automatic  Feature Interaction Selection in Factorization  Models for  Click-Through Rate Prediction

This is the tensorflow implementation of AutoFIS in the following paper:
Bin Liu, Chenxu Zhu, Guilin Li, Weinan Zhang, Jincai Lai, Ruiming Tang, Xiuqiang He, Zhenguo Li, Yong Yu. AutoFIS: Automatic Feature Interaction Selection in Factorization Models for Click-Through Rate Prediction. KDD 2020.  

__init__.py contain some parameter setting and other in main file.
Dataset download link and how to use could be seen in dataset.txt.

Our model AutoFIS has two stages: search stage and retrain stage. You could run model and get important interactions. According to the important interactions, you change the **comb_mask** and **comb_mask_third** in the main file. In the search stage, for architecture parameters, you have to use Grda Optimizer. In the retrain stage, you have to apply Adam Optimizer.

run tf_main_autofm.py could apply AutoFIS to FM and it is the main file of AutoFM.

run tf_main_autodeepfm.py could apply AutoFIS to DeepFM and it is the main file of AutoDeepFM.
